# Mouse Trajectory Based Interaction Intent Recognition and Prediction for Medical Image Reading

In response to the current issue of missing mouse interaction datasets in medical image reading, a framework for constructing mouse interaction datasets is proposed. Based on this framework, a mouse interaction dataset (MID) containing 20 types of medical image reading interaction intents is constructed for a customized chest X-ray assisted reading system, along with the corresponding interaction intent label set (IIL).
